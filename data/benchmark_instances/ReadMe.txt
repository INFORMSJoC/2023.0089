The instance gives the region to be packed, where the region consists of a polygonal container C and K (K>=0) polygonal holes. 

The number in the first line gives the number |V| of vertices of polygonal container C, and then the coordinates of vertices of container are given as follows:
x_1 y_1
x_2 y_2
x_3 y_3
.......
x_|V| y_|V|
x_1 y_1 

Then, the information about the polygonal holes is given as follows: 
H  |V_k| 
x_1 y_1
x_2 y_2
x_3 y_3
.......
x_|V_k| y_|V_k|
x_1 y_1
end

where |V_k| shows the number of vertices for the k-th polygonal hole 
and (x_i,y_i) gives the coordinates of i-th vertex of the hole.
